Feedback
--------
Dear Catherine, Kimberly, & William, You lost some points in the design
document, code readability, & Javadoc comments. Great to see that you
included Integration tests. Moreover, if there is an inconsistency in
the grades among the team members, it is perhaps due to the Reflections
document. If you have any concerns about your grade, please feel free to
contact me and visit me during office hours. Good job! -Esha
