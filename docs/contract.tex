\section{ Goals }
As a team we want to create a well-working project worthy of an A grade. We would also like to have a reasonable code base, and ideally one that is easily repurposable for future similar project.

\section{ czuo's Goals }
I hope to use the techniques covered in class and the p-sets so far to help implement a larger-scale project that has good design and runs smoothly.  
\section{ toyk2a's Goals }
\section{ woursler's Goals }
If possible, I think it would be pretty cool if our grammar was loaded from file, but that's a pipe dream.

\section{Meeting Norms}
We are all free on Monday afternoons and would prefer to meet in the daytime but are open to holding meetings at night.  They will typically be held either in Next House of Simmons dormitory.
