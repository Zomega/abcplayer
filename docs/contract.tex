\section{ Goals }
As a team we want to create a well-working project worthy of an A grade. We would also like to have a reasonable code base, and ideally one that is easily repurposable for future similar project.

\subsection{ czuo's Goals }
I hope to use the techniques covered in class and the p-sets so far to help implement a larger-scale project that has good design and runs smoothly.  
\subsection{ toyk2a's Goals }
\subsection{ woursler's Goals }
If possible, I think it would be pretty cool if our grammar was loaded from file, but that's a pipe dream. My goal is to get something functional fast, and then polish it a bit.

\section{Meeting Norms}
We are all free on Monday afternoons and would prefer to meet in the daytime but are open to holding meetings at night.  They will typically be held either in Next House or Simmons dormitory.  
\newline
\\We will all attend class on the days of class work sessions and will continue work on our project or hold our design discussions.  
\newline
\\Our meetings outside of class will be held about every two days and for as long as necessary.  
\newline
\\We will record meeting minutes and action lists on Google Docs and share the document with all the team members during the meeting.  

\section{Work Norms}

What will happen if someone does not follow through on a commitment (e.g., missing a deadline, not showing up to meetings)? We kill them. With fire.

\section{Decision Making}

We need consensus to do anything major until we have something functional. After that, it is acceptable to work on pet projects after discussing them, but not in master. Changes should be carefully reviewed by at least one other member before they are merged.
