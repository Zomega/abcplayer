<h2><a name="problem">Problem</a></h2>

<p>
  Composition of a musical piece is often a trial-and-error process,
  in which the musician writes down a series of notes on paper and
  tests them out on a musical instrument.  One way to
  do this on a computer is to type the notes into a text file using a
  special notation and feed them to a program that understands this
  notation. This way, you can transcribe your favorite pieces of music
  or compose your own pieces, and easily exchange them among your
  friends on the web.
</p>

<p>
  <b>abc</b> is one of the languages designed for this purpose. 
  It was originally intended for notating folk and traditional tunes of
  Western Europe, but it provides a sufficient set of constructs for
  transcribing a reasonably complex piece of music, such as
  <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~sla/abcmusic/sym7mov2.html"> a Beethoven
  symphony</a>. Since its invention in 1980's, abc has become one of
  the most popular notations for music, with around 50,000 
  abc files circulating around the web.
<p> 
  In this project, you will build an <i>abc player</i> that plays an
  abc file, by parsing it and feeding it to the Java MIDI API.  You
  are required to handle only a subset of the abc language, which we will
  discuss in more detail below in the
  <a href="#specification">Specification</a> section. This subset is
  sufficient to play a large number of interesting tunes 
  that are available on the web, but you are welcome to implement the
  rest of the standard, as long as your overall design remains clean
  and simple.
</p>

</p>

<h2><a name="purpose">Purpose</a></h2>

<p> 
  The purpose of this project is to help you gain experience with:
  <ul>
    <li>Designing and implementing programs in the functional style (that
    is, making extensive use of functions over immutable types).</li>
    <li>Designing and implementing abstract types.
    <li>Using common design patterns for constructing and traversing structures
    (such as Variant as Class, Interpreter, Iterator, and Visitor).</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  This project will also offer an opportunity to continue working with the
  fundamentals of compilation, including:
  <ul>
    <li>Expressing a language as a grammar.</li>
    <li>Converting a text to an abstract syntax tree.</li>
    <li>Organizing a compiler into phases (lexing, parsing,
    static semantic analysis, etc).</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  Finally, the project will give you further practice in software engineering
  fundamentals, such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Clarifying a problem statement.</li>
    <li>Inventing clear and simple interfaces to minimize coupling, and
    identifying and resolving undesirable dependencies.</li>
    <li>Structuring a program to make it easily testable, organizing, executing
    and evaluating test suites.</li>
    <li>Working collaboratively in a team.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="specification">Specification</a></h2>

<p>
You are required to implement a subset of abc notation. The subset that you are
required to implement is described in a separate document:
<a href="abc_subset_description.html"><b>The ABC Subset for 6.005</b></a>.
Also, we are giving you a grammar in an EBNF that corresponds to the subset:
<a href="assignment_files/abc_subset_bnf.txt"><b>The ABC Subset Grammar</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
If you would like, you are welcome to go beyond this subset. For your interest,
the full abc EBNF can be found <a href="http://www.norbeck.nu/abc/abcbnf.htm">here</a>.
However, you are only required to implement the <b>ABC Subset for 6.005</b>.
</p>

<p>
Note: You are NOT allowed to use any code taken from an existing abc player
as a part of your implementation in this project.
</p>

<h2><a name="tasks">Tasks</a></h2>

<p>
During this project, you will perform the following tasks. The <a href="#deliverables">
Deliverables and Grading</a> section specifies when each component is due.
<ul>
<li><b>Team Contracts</b> &mdash; Before you begin, you should write and agree to a
team contract. Please see <a href="teamcontract.html">this page</a> for details.     
</li>

<li><b>Warmup</b> &mdash; There are some warmup exercises that you need to do, listed below.  They will help you learn about how the abc music player works. 
</li>

<li><b>Design</b> &mdash; Using the <a href="assignment_files/abc_subset_bnf.txt"><b>The ABC Subset Grammar</b></a>,
you will need to consider the datatype definitions you would like to use to represent the parsed input, as well as
the music itself. In particular, you should think about what you'll need to do to transform the
parsed input into a format that can be easily played. Your software's design is perhaps the most important
part of the project; a good design will make it simpler to implement and debug your music player.
</li>

<li><b>Implementation</b> &mdash; Implement the project in Java. 
You may find that you want to make changes to your design. You
are free to do this, but should record the changes so it is clear how
and why you diverged from the original. Remember to do test-first programming.
</li>

<li><b>Tests</b> &mdash; Test your entire system on the staff sample files. 
Furthermore, create at least three additional abc files as tests. These should show that your player
is able to correctly parse and play various musical constructs, as well as detect any semantic
errors in an abc file. You should also have JUnit tests that test smaller components of your
system (including, but certainly not limited to, your Lexer and Parser).
</li>

<li><b>Reflection</b> &mdash; Write a brief commentary saying what you
learned from this experience. What was easy? What was hard? What was
unexpected? Briefly evaluate your solution, pointing out its key
merits and deficiencies. This is an individual activity.  
</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="infrastructure">Infrastructure</a></h2>

<p>Before you start the project, you should learn
  about the <b>Java MIDI Sequencer</b>. It allows you to schedule a series of notes to be
  played at certain time intervals.</p>

<p>Look at the package <tt>sound</tt> under <tt>src</tt>, and study
  the provided class, <tt>SequencePlayer</tt>.  For this project, you
  will not need to modify this class, but you should become
  comfortable using its constructor and the
  methods <tt>addNote</tt> and <tt>play</tt>.
</p>

<p><b>SequencePlayer(int beatsPerMinute, int ticksPerQuarterNote)</b>: The
    constructor for <tt>SequencePlayer</tt> takes two parameters:
  <ul>
    <li><p>The first, <tt>beatsPerMinute</tt>, is the tempo of a
    musical piece. It is expressed in the number of beats per minute (BPM),
    where each beat is equal to the duration of one quarter
    note. The BPM to be used for a particular piece depends on the
    value of the optional tempo field ('Q') in the input abc
    file. When this field is absent, the default tempo is 100 BPM,
    where each beat is equal in duration to the
    default note length (indicated by the field 'L'). </p>
    </li>
    <li> <p>The second parameter, <tt>ticksPerQuarterNote</tt>,
    corresponds to the number of ticks per quarter note. Note that
    ticks used by the sequencer are based on discrete time. Think
    about how large this number needs to be in order to play notes of
    different durations in an abc piece. For example,
    if <tt>ticksPerQuarterNote</tt> had a value of 2, then an eighth
    note would be played for the duration of one tick, but you would
    not be able to schedule a sixteenth note for the correct
    duration.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p><b>addNote(int note, int startTick, int numTicks)</b>: This method
  schedules a note to be played at <tt>startTick</tt> for the duration
  of <tt>numTicks</tt>. Here, a "tick" is similar to a time step. At
  the beginning of a musical piece, the global tick is initialized to
  0, and as the music progresses through the notes, the global tick is
  incremented by some number. The first parameter <tt>note</tt> is a MIDI
  note value that
  corresponds to the pitch of a note. The provided
  class <tt>Pitch</tt> contains a number of useful methods for working
  with pitches. In particular, the method <tt>toMidiNote</tt> returns the
  MIDI note value of the particular note, and <tt>transpose</tt> can
  be used to transpose the note some number of semitones up or down.
</p>

<p><b>play()</b>: After all of the notes have been scheduled, you can
  invoke <tt>play</tt> to tell the sequencer to begin playing the music. 
</p>

<p>Run the main method in <tt>SequencePlayer</tt>, which shows an
  example of using a sequencer to play up and down a C major
  scale. In this example, all of the notes in the scale have been
  hard-coded. In your abc player, you will be walking over your data
  structures that represent a musical piece and automatically schedule 
  the notes at appropriate ticks.
</p>



<p>We are also providing some example abc files that you can use to
  test your abc player. (These are included in the git
  repository under the folder <tt>sample_abc</tt>). They are:
<ul>
<li>
 <a href="sample_abc/scale.abc"><tt>A simple scale
 (scale.abc)</tt></a>
</li>
<li>
 <a href="sample_abc/little_night_music.abc"><tt>A Little Night Music
 by W. A. Mozart (little_night_music.abc)</tt></a>
</li>
<li>
 <a href="sample_abc/paddy.abc"><tt>Paddy O'Rafferty, an Irish tune
 (paddy.abc)</tt></a>
</li>
<li>
 <a href="sample_abc/invention.abc"><tt>Invention by J. S. Bach
 (invention.abc)</tt></a>
</li>

</li>
<li>
 <a href="sample_abc/fur_elise.abc"><tt>Fur Elise by L. v. Beethoven (fur_elise.abc)</tt></a>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can find many more examples online,
including <a href="http://www.walshaw.plus.com/abc/examples/">here</a>.

<h2><a name="lab">Warmup</a></h2>

<p>
Note: If you don't understand musical notation, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_musical_symbols">
this Wikipedia page</a> may be helpful.
</p>

<p><b>Task 1</b>: Transcribe each of the following small pieces of music
 into an abc file.  Name your files as <b>piece1.abc</b>
 and <b>piece2.abc</b>, respectively, and commit them under the
 directory <tt>sample_abc</tt> in your team's git repository.
</p>
<p>You may find the <a href="abc_subset_description.html"><b>ABC Subset for 6.005</b></a> useful here.<p> 

<p><u>Piece 1</u>: A simple, 4/4 meter piece with triplets. As a
  starter, the header and the first two bars are already
  provided. You should complete the rest of the piece by transcribing
  the last two bars.
<pre> 
<img src="assignment_files/piece1.png" border="1">

</p>

<p>
<pre>

T:Piece No.1
M:4/4
L:1/4
Q: 140
K:C
C C C3/4 D/4 E | E3/4 D/4 E3/4 F/4 G2 |
</pre>
</p>

<p><u>Piece 2</u>: A more complex piece, with chords, accidentals,
  and rests. <b>Set its tempo to 200, with the default note length of 1/4.</b> The piece below is only an excerpt, and the last measure is not a full measure. Pad the piece with enough rests to complete the measure.   
<pre> 
<img src="assignment_files/piece2.png" border="1">
</pre>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  <b>Task 2</b>: Write JUnit tests that play these pieces using the
  sequencer, similar to the main method in the <tt>SequencePlayer</tt>
  class. Store them in a separate class called <b><tt>SequencePlayerTest</tt></b>.
  Didit cannot play music for you, so you'll want to tell Didit to ignore this test
  file. See <a href="#testing">Automated Testing</a> for how to tell Didit to
  ignore a test file.
</p>

<p><b>Hint:</b> <tt>SequencePlayer</tt> has a <tt>toString</tt> method
that produces a string representation of all its events. If you are
not confident in your listening skills, this might be
useful if you want to compare sequences that sound the same.</p>

<h2><a name="deliverables">Deliverables and Grading</a></h2>

<p>
  Note that you will be able to work on your projects in-class on March 15, 18, 20, 22, and April 1.
</p>

<p>
  The <b><u>milestone deadline</u></b> is Tuesday, March 19, 2013 at 11:59pm. The deliverables are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your <b>Team Contract</b>. In your team's git repository, there is a folder called <tt>docs</tt>.
  You should place your contract in <tt>docs/team-contract.pdf</tt>.</li>
  <li>Your <b>Warmup</b> exercises. Place your pieces (<tt>piece1.abc</tt> and <tt>piece2.abc</tt>)
  in the <tt>sample_abc</tt> directory in your team's git repository. Also include your <tt>SequencePlayerTest</tt>
  class in team's your git repository.</li>
  <li>Your <b>Design</b>. Place your design in <tt>docs/design-milestone.pdf</tt> in your team's git repository.
  Your design must address, at the very least, the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Think about the datatypes your music player will require. List these datatypes, state whether
      they are mutable or immutable, and list their operations. For each operation, provide a short
      description of what it does. Also, we encourage (but do not require) you to include a dependency
      diagram.</li>
      <li>You may wish to modify the given <a href="assignment_files/abc_subset_bnf.txt">grammar</a>
      we give you to make parsing input easier. This is ok, as long as it continues
      to fit the specifications. If you do wish to modify the grammar, include your modified
      grammar in your design.</li>
      <li>Demonstrate how your parser is going to work. You can do this by describing its individual
      methods, by displaying a state machine diagram, or through some other format. Additionally,
      demonstrate how your parser will detect and handle semantic errors in an input abc file.</li>
      <li>Describe how you will take a representation of the input (e.g., your AST) and transform
      it into a format that you can cleanly play using <tt>SequencePlayer</tt>.
      <li>List the components of your system that you believe can and should be tested. For each of
      these components, describe your testing strategy and describe at least three specific test
      cases you plan to have.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Your team will be randomly assigned a TA who will help you with your design and ensure you're on the right
track before you implement your player. Meetings with TAs will occur on March 20, 21, and 22.
Your TA will get in touch with you to setup that meeting.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  The <b><u>final deadline</u></b> is Tuesday, April 2, 2013 at 11:59pm. The deliverables are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your <b>Revised Design</b>. As you implement your player, you will likely need to modify your
  original design. Start this revised design with a summary of what changed from your milestone
  design. Place your revised design in <tt>docs/design-revised.pdf</tt> in your team's
  git repository.</li>
  <li>Your <b>implementation</b>. All your code should be completed by this deadline!</li>
  <li>Your <b>tests</b>. As described in <a href="#tasks">Tasks</a>, you must write at least
  three abc files beyond the ones we give you. Your JUnit tests should also be completed by
  this deadline.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>
  The <b><u>reflections deadline</u></b> is Thursday, April 4, 2013 at 11:59pm. In your reflections, you should address the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reflections on your team &mdash; How did you feel the team did? How well did your team work together? How was the coding? How did you split the work?</li>
  <li>Reflections on yourself &mdash; How do you think you did? What specific contributions did you make? How do you feel about your contributions?</li>
</ul>
<p>A Stellar assignment will be created for reflections. Please submit your reflections as a <tt>pdf</tt> to Stellar.</p>

<br>

<p>
  Other than reflections, all parts of the project should be committed in the repository you share with your
  teammates. Each commit to the repository should have a comment saying what you changed, as well as who worked on it.
  Your TA will be reviewing your git log to see individual contributions. Make sure you commit frequently!
</p>

<p>
  Grades will be allotted according to the following breakdown:
<ul>
<li>  Team Contract &mdash; 5%
<li>  Design &mdash; 25%
<li>  Implementation &mdash; 50%
<li>  Testing &mdash; 15%
<li>  Reflection &mdash; 5%
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="testing">Automated Testing</a></h2>
<p>
  Starting with Problem Set 0, you have been using the Didit system for automated building and testing: every time you push your commits to Athena, the Didit build server pulls a copy of your code, attempts to compile it, and runs tests.
  This kind of automation is very common in the world of professional software development, and is very useful for coordinating a team of developers.
  There is no ambiguity about whether the code compiles or not: if it doesn't compile on the build server, it doesn't compile.
  And there is no ambiguity about whether the tests pass: if they don't pass on the build server, they don't pass.
</p>
<p>
  For this project, Didit will run <b>your</b> tests: any JUnit tests you check in to your team's project repository will be executed and the results included in your Didit build report.
  Tests must be in the <code>src</code> directory with a name like <code><i>[something]</i>Test.java</code> or <code><i>[something]</i>Tests.java</code> for Didit to find them.
</p>
<p>
  Your tests will be run in an environment with limited permissions and resources.
  (E.g., filesystem access only to your <code>src</code> and <code>sample_abc</code> directories.)
  Any deliberate attempts to circumvent these restrictions are a violation of course policy and academic standards, and will be dealt with harshly.
  However:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you find that Didit is unable to run some of your tests but you think they are reasonable and should be supported, email the TAs and include <b>&quot;Didit test restrictions&quot;</b> in the subject line.
    This is the first semester 6.005 is offering automated builds, so you might try things we didn't think of.
    Hopefully we will be able to make Didit more accommodating.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>You are likely to have at least some tests Didit cannot run (e.g., tests which require the MIDI synthesizer).
    <i>Don't let Didit's restrictions stop you from writing such tests.</i>
    Instead, for these tests, include the Javadoc tag <b><code>@category&nbsp;no_didit</code></b> on the test class.
    <i>All tests in that file will be ignored.</i> You cannot use <b><code>@category&nbsp;no_didit</code></b> on methods &mdash; you must use it on the class.
    Here's an example:
  </li>
</ul>

<pre>
<b>package</b> player;
<b>import</b> org.junit.Test;
/**
 * Test some super complicated stuff.
 * <b>@category</b> no_didit
 */
<b>public</b> <b>class</b> SuperComplicatedTest {
  
    @Test <b>public</b> <b>void</b> testBWV1010() {
      // Didit will not run this test
    }
    // nor any other tests in this file
}
</pre>

<p>
  On your build results page, Didit will report which tests it attempted to run, and which tests it skipped.
  Make sure you and your teammates are running those tests manually.
</p>
<p>
  If you include no tests, Didit will count that as a pass &mdash; remember to also check whether your code compiled!
</p>

<h2><a name="hints">Hints</a></h2>

<p>
<b>Start early!</b> This project is more work than it seems. 
Starting early on the project will give you more time to sort
out any issues and ask the staff questions that may arise, especially if you have trouble with transcribing music.
</p>

<p><b>Lexing and parsing</b>: Given the grammar for abc, you will need
to build a lexer that breaks the input string into tokens. You may find
the Java pattern matching libraries such as <tt>java.util.regex.Pattern</tt>
and <tt>java.util.regex.Matcher</tt> helpful for lexing, but you should use them
judiciously. You will also need to build a parser that groups the tokens into a valid syntactic
construct and produces an abstract syntax tree (AST). We recommend that you think
carefully about your approach to parsing the abc file; consider how to
make it easiest to write a single parser that can handle the entire
file, with complexities such as bars split across lines.
</p>

<p>
<b>Designing datatypes</b>: For the design of your abc player, you
should think carefully about datatypes that you need to
represent the musical constructs in abc. Start with simple constructs,
such as notes and rests, and think about how you would build up on
these primitive objects to create more complex structures. How would
you represent a triplet? A chord? What does a bar consist of? How
would you represent multiple voices? Sort out answers to these
questions with your team members during the design stage.
</p>

<p>
<b>Evaluating expressions</b>: Once you parse an abc file and create
your own internal representation of the music as an abstract syntax
tree (AST), you will need to perform various computations that involve
traversing the tree, possibly multiple times.  Consider carefully the
patterns you learned for performing these traversals: you may want to
use the visitor pattern, though an interpreter pattern might also work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Multiple voices</b>: A particular challenge is how you will represent
multiple voices, and how you will merge them into a single sequence of midi events.
We recommend thinking about this challenge early in your design process.
</p>

<p>
<b>Use classtime wisely</b>: Lecture and recitation are being replaced with
time for team/TA meetings on March 15, 18, 20, 22, and April 1.
You should use the time to work on the project, or meet up with your TA.</p>
