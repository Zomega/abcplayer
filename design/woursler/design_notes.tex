Fractions are rather important for meter / note length. Maybe we should have some sort of fraction class to avoid weird float error problems?

Repeats are going to be fun, and may require some special consideration with regard to the data structures... Alternatively, we could do some sort of visitor pattern with a stack to track last seen open repeat. How exactly would this handle multiple endings?

Accidentals are a bit tricky. Should be handled in the data structure or in processing?

Also, its worth noting that all accidentals precede the notes they affect, unlike octave effects...

Tuplets and spaces? We should be able to put in spaces, no?
